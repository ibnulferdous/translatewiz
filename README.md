# Translatewiz

This is an example app built with the official remix template. Here I used Google Translator to translate the webpage into different languages. To deploy and test this app, please go through the following steps.

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
2. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you donâ€™t have one.
3. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).
